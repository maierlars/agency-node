Contributing
============

We welcome bug fixes and patches from 3rd party contributors! 

Please follow these guidelines if you want to contribute to VelocyPack:

* If you found a bug: if the bug you found is not yet described in an existing
  Github issue, please file a new one. The new issue should include a clear
  description of the bug and how to reproduce it (including your OS / environment).

* If you want to contribute code, documentation or a missing feature, please 
  develop and test the feature locally first and then send us a pull request.
  Please note that we require you to sign the [Contributor Agreement](https://www.arangodb.com/documents/cla.pdf)
  before we can accept your pull requests.
  Code changes in the VelocyPack library should use the "Google" style and
  conventions as used by *clang-format*. 

* Please let us know if you plan to work on a ticket. This way we can make sure
  redundant work is avoided.
